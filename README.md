# 🚀 SpaceShip
This is my first game i ever made , it was 3 years ago, back to 2018 !<br><br>
I did it on Unity, using C#. <br><br>
Unfortunatly i've lost the source code so I can only share the "final" game.<br>


## Controls
- use ZQSD to move (french keyboard 🐸)<br>
- Left Click to shoot<br>
- Space to change the flying type (UBER : you move faster and follow the mouse)<br>
- R to reset<br><br><br>

# 📁 Two Folder Left
The name doesn't matter, i never finished this one because I lose the source code too...
In this one you have to gather the two character at the final point the fast as you can ! 
The point of the game lies in the fact that you control both characters at the same time with different controls.


## Controls
- ZQSD for the left character
- Arrows for the right one
