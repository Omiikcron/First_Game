# 🚀 SpaceShip
This is my first game i ever made , it was 3 years ago, back to 2018 !<br><br>
I did it on Unity, using C#. <br><br>
Unfortunatly i've lost the source code so I can only share the "final" game.<br>


## Controls
- use ZQSD to move (french keyboard 🐸)<br>
- Left Click to shoot<br>
- Space to change the flying type (UBER : you move faster and follow the mouse)<br>
- R to reset

### Hope you can enjoy this clunky game ! Download <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dymPy38pz7LhjB7Kj7cZgKVDLfxtbpHf?usp=sharing">here</a>.
